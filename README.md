This this project is officially dead. Feel free to use what's done though.

Naive â€“ haxenme component game engine.
My first attempt at component based game architecture. Maybe I should call it Stupid instead.
It's highly experimental and will change often while I incorporate new features.

TODO: game state representation or how do I switch from menu screen to level 1 then level 2 then maybe game over etc.
TODO: passing data between states or scores
